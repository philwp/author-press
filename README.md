A sample WordPress plugin for the a11y meetup

## About

The plugin is for listing books for sale on an external website such as Amazon. It uses custom post types and the block editor with blocks created using Advanced Custom Fields Pro.

This plugin was intentionally built to have no external dependencies or build tools such as composer or npm so that anyone attending the meetup can interact more easily with the code.
